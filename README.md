## Problem: 
It’s very time-consuming to manually create product descriptions for every new product launched. There are four product types each requiring a unique format to the product description. Business owners are a team of two, that are wearing all the hats and doing all the things… they don’t have the time to dedicate properly to crafting unique & funny on-brand product descriptions, nor can they afford to hire this out.

## Solution: 
They need a Custom chatbot that can write unique on-brand product descriptions that speak to their unique audience while maintaining their existing voice. This will dramatically improve and speed up the product listing creation process. This solution provides a copy/paste ready description that will require minor to no editing.

## Implementation: 
I created a CustomGPT on ChatGPT with heavily engineered prompting and context to include their unique requirements for product descriptions of their four different product types. Using few-shot prompting techniqes and providing context on the role of the GPT, intended audience, tone direction and language restrictions, the CustomGPT was optimized to meet project requirements.

I further iterated on this project to learn the new OpenAI Responses API and made an API Chatbot that is hosted on Huggingface with a simple UI from Gradio.
